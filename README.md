The web design features a League of Legends 'simulator' type app, which allows the user to select between four different champions, and a variety of different weapons and armors which allow the user to simulate how their character might perform with different equipment. Each weapon or piece of armor is associated with statictics in one or more categories including health, damage, health restoration, and armor, among others. The user may choose them incrementally to see how their selected champion behaves with these enhancements

In addtion, the user might also choose to modify one or more values and save their modifications to an external database

The website was built with Angular, Gulp, and Parse free software packages
